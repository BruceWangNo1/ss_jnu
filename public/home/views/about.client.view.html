		<h3>About</h3>
		<p class="lead">SS-JNU is a one-year college venture project funded by Jinan University. And that is why the the name includes 'JNU'. SS-JNU is developed by Wang Yong and Jialing Yu. The major audience of this project is students from Jinan University.</p>
		<p class="lead">The framework SS-JNU takes advantage of is M*EAN(MySQL, Express, Angular, Node) Stack. MySQL is a traditional relational database management system for information storage like user information; Express is a web application framework that runs on Node. Angular is a JavaScript MVC framework that runs in brower JavaScript engines like Google V8 engine in Chrome. Node is an execution environment for event-driven server-side and networking applications. M*EAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications. </p>
		<p class="lead">Since SS-JNU benefited from the two major open-source projects: <a href="https://github.com/mengskysama/shadowsocks/tree/manyuser" target="_blank">Shadowsocks(manyuser)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orvice/ss-panel" target="_blank">SS-Panel</a>, I decided to make SS-JNU open-source as well to contribute to the open-source community. Source code and detailed information on <a href="https://github.com/BruceWangNo1/ss_jnu" target="_blank">my Github repository</a>.</p>
