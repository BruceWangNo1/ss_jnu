		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>This database application development project is about information query of students from Jinan University. The data is from the university, of course. And the framework this project takes advantage of is MEAN(MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) Stack and MySQL service. MongoDB is a NoSQL database for user signup and validation purpose; Express.js is a web application framework that runs on Node.js. Angular.js is a JavaScript MVC framework that runs in browser JavaScript engines like Goolge V8 engine in Chrome. Node.js is an execution environment for event-driven server-side and networking applications. MySQL is a traditional relational database management system which is used for storing and querying JNU student information. MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications. </p>
		<p>The MEAN stack makes use of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js. Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.</p>
		<p>I decided to make this project open-source, source code and detailed information on <a href="https://github.com/BruceWangNo1/jnu_database" target="_blank">my Github repository</a>.</p>
